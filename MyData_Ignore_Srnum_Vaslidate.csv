First, half the units showed both Line-Line Voltage (480Vac) and Line-Neutral Voltage (277Vac) while the other half did not.  Pics attached.  These RPP√≠s (if you can call them that) are Facebook specific and have trendpoint meters and none of our monitoring.  Speaking to Thun it seems like we should have received them already set up correctly.  I logged into the display (via touch screen) and also the meter base (using web interface with TCP/IP on laptop) and could not figure out how to reconfigure.  The site prefers that online line-Neutral be displayed on Main screen.  Also the ones that showed L-L also had setup button at the top right of screen while the ones not showing L-L did not have that setup button.  I believe this issue may be firmware related but without know much about these meters it√≠s difficult to say.  Please advise.

Also, we have one unit with phantom currents being displayed.  I was limited on troubleshooting live gear (Facebook was right on top of me) and they would not give permission to shut it back down.  The unit was completely unloaded and I verified with clampon.  It was showing current on all three phases and the neutral (around 150A) and I believe the meter base will need to be replaced.  The wiring of the CT√≠s looked solid and I doubt all 4 CT√≠s could be failed.

32,5004600000A1uIJAAZ,"From Tommy Waugh: Once energized I did notice a few issues I could not resolve.  

First, half the units showed both Line-Line Voltage (480Vac) and Line-Neutral Voltage (277Vac) while the other half did not.  Pics attached.  These RPP√≠s (if you can call them that) are Facebook specific and have trendpoint meters and none of our monitoring.  Speaking to Thun it seems like we should have received them already set up correctly.  I logged into the display (via touch screen) and also the meter base (using web interface with TCP/IP on laptop) and could not figure out how to reconfigure.  The site prefers that online line-Neutral be displayed on Main screen.  Also the ones that showed L-L also had setup button at the top right of screen while the ones not showing L-L did not have that setup button.  I believe this issue may be firmware related but without know much about these meters it√≠s difficult to say.  Please advise.

Also, we have one unit with phantom currents being displayed.  I was limited on troubleshooting live gear (Facebook was right on top of me) and they would not give permission to shut it back down.  The unit was completely unloaded and I verified with clampon.  It was showing current on all three phases and the neutral (around 150A) and I believe the meter base will need to be replaced.

Hello Mohammed,

I√≠m in the field supporting commissioning on 20 Infinity PDU√≠s.  I have had some issues that I√≠ve worked through but there is a single issue that I need some help with.  

PDU S/N 112-0056-17

The display is communicating locally/remotely and all functions seem to work correctly with the exception of the LED directly below the touchscreen.  I suspected that the micro SD card has some issue.  I removed the control power and swapped the SD card with another unit, and the LED started working again.  I put the original card back in the display.  I√≠d like to get your input on a possible cause and see if you could supply me with the correct files to store on the SD card.  

I have attached pics from the display and of our label.


Issue two: notes from tommy - spread sheet attached 

Spent most of the day working at Serverfarm on the Infinity startups/commissioning.  We have 26 issues assigned to us onsite that will require some sort of resolution to move forward.

I√≠ve explained to them that the software issues is a priority for us and we have people on it, with some resolution soon.  

Total issues are 26 as I said with 10 related to these software glitches/resets, 1 is a fuse I need to replace (I√≠ll try to source locally), CT strip issues (may be software but they appear to be bad CT√≠s), and we also had some breakers trip during load bank burn in today.

The breakers tripping were likely due to high ambient temps in the room.  Cooling has been locking up during burnins and the ambient got over 95deg during the two hour burn in.  Surface temps on the breakers exceeded 120 deg F.  We had 4 pdu√≠s that had tripped breakers.  We reset and restarted burn in.  After burnin we also let the room cool for 2 hrs and reloaded only those breakers to just under max capacity for 2 additional hours.  No further tripping.

We have a significant number of ct strips not registering currents.  By my count we have tested 40 panel boards (10 pdus, so half of them) and I have missing currents on at least 12 CT strips.  There may be more as I was rushing to get the testing done but also trying to get pics and notes.  I√≠ll supply more detail on this tomorrow.

I have also run an ISSUE report and formatted it for excel which I am attaching for your review.  I only have two more days there before IST so issue resolution is gonna be difficult since we have about 10 more units to test.",PCBA - Hardware Issue,The parts were shipped and Tommy resolved the issue.,Hardware/Parts Provided,Display,replace,Closed,12/3/2018 14:19,PDU,PDU,10.0,Product_1__c,False

Aurora, IL  60502",PCBA - Hardware Issue,On site to replace BCMS PCA that was thought to have generated erroneous current readings on customer's BMS curent was randomly flip flopping between subfeed breakers. Connected laptop to BCMS and verified correct sub feed currents on PDU. PDU front panel is addressed at 21 which means the BMS was accessing address 223 for the BCMS. Removed power from BCMS PCA and the currents were still randomly jumoping which led me to believe it was not the BCMS PCA. I looked at the PDU 1A4-2 and discovered the front panel was addressed at 23 which madde me think there is a conflict with the BMS. I believe the BMS was polling  both addresses on two different PDUs which was causing the erroneous currents. I removed the upstream plug on 1A4-2 and the random current ceased. I still removed BCMS PCA and installedd the new one and the problem still existed. I removed the new PCA and re-intalled the original. We decided to address PDU1A4-2 front panel to 24 and poll 25 and 26 for the BMS. Once we did this the erroneous currents ceased and all readings on both PDU's are accurate.

For the Monitor,
I had a SAS D voting and a SAS TX 3 Alarms that would not go away.
 After troubleshooting I found out that I had a bad slot on TX 3.
For the Contractor board,
I was having problem seeing the PDU√≠s subfeed breakers which it√≠s communication wires come from the Bcms to the modbus downstream of the contractor board.

561,5004600000A268fAAB,"From Customer: Good afternoon Thun, 
Can you please help me out with getting part information and repair procedures for these deficiencies found during the last maintenance cycle?
The attached images are for the deficiencies found for the CT plugs and wires on the M4G board. We would need to know the repair procedure for this board and partial wire harness/plug replacement. 
The B4 PDU has CTs that were disconnected and not shorted so at the recommendation of the techs, those CTs are most likely bad now and would need to be replaced. 
Could you also provide a repair procedure for the CT replacement so we can determine when we would be able to schedule the PDU for repair?
The QC4 PDU BC1 is another one high on the priority list since the TVSS is currently bad along with the fuse block. Could you please include the repair procedures for this?

From Keith Waterman: I spoke with both Jeff and Vince as they did the PM.
Yes the M4-G boards will have to be replaced and the connector will be cut off and replaced with new. Wire will be cut back to remove damaged insulation, then reterminated.
The fuse block feeding the TVSS and TVSS itself will have to be replaced as there is a short inside the existing TVSS that caused fuses to blow and damage to fuse block.
The subfeed CTs were never terminated to a BCMS resistor board as there is no BCMS or Resistor card on the unit. I don√≠ know if it was removed or never ordered with, but it is strange that the unit would be installed with CTS on the output breakers without this circuitry. I√≠ll look at the SN to see if it was originally configured with monitoring.",Hardware Issue - Loose Connection,Holmes Electric handled all site visits and resolved issues,Site Visit,SPD,replace,Closed,12/17/2019 16:33,PDU,PDU,7.0,Product_1__c,False

The B4 PDU has CTs that were disconnected and not shorted so at the recommendation of the techs, those CTs are most likely bad now and would need to be replaced. 
Could you also provide a repair procedure for the CT replacement so we can determine when we would be able to schedule the PDU for repair?
The QC4 PDU BC1 is another one high on the priority list since the TVSS is currently bad along with the fuse block. Could you please include the repair procedures for this?

From Keith Waterman: I spoke with both Jeff and Vince as they did the PM.
Yes the M4-G boards will have to be replaced and the connector will be cut off and replaced with new. Wire will be cut back to remove damaged insulation, then reterminated.
The fuse block feeding the TVSS and TVSS itself will have to be replaced as there is a short inside the existing TVSS that caused fuses to blow and damage to fuse block.
The subfeed CTs were never terminated to a BCMS resistor board as there is no BCMS or Resistor card on the unit. I don√≠ know if it was removed or never ordered with, but it is strange that the unit would be installed with CTS on the output breakers without this circuitry. I√≠ll look at the SN to see if it was originally configured with monitoring.",Hardware Issue - Loose Connection,Holmes Electric handled all site visits and resolved issues,Site Visit,SPD,replace,Closed,12/17/2019 16:33,nan,,0.0,Product_2__c,True

From customer:     We turned on the new PDI RPP√≠s on the second floor, so that we can validate any possible issues with the BCMS and CT√≠s. As far as we can see, these look to be in good working order. But, we did find some missing covers on the 400amp main. I have attached pictures of ones with the covers and one with missing covers. We open all of the RPP√≠s and found 3 breakers are missing both top and bottom covers. I have taken pictures of the bottom side of the breaker, which shows what should be covered. We should get with PDI and have them send out 3 sets, or a total of 6 individual covers. The covers are designed to fit on top or bottom
