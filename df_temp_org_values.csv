47,troubleshooted the switch last night and did not find any particular issue with the equipment. It did not perform perfectly through the reset and restore process. After a calibration and a full reset of the breakers we did get the switch to operate as normal. I performed several transfers without issue. The customer decided to leave the switch in bypass on their preferred source (Source 2). Speaking with Costas the next step would be to potentially change some boards and go from there. One of the theories is that something downstream could have caused an issue as well but we do not have any evidence of that.

From Ajith: Urbacon is GE√≠s customer and Microsoft is the end user. Customer is changing the 250A trip plug from 400A trip plugs for all three CBs in all PDUs. This means 3X 5ft long 3/O wire needs to be added to each breaker. ABB and the contractor will buy the breaker and CTs for the modification. What they need from us is 72X 5ft long 3/O wires and associated lugs/hardware. I have listed below the materials given by engineering. GE/ABB also requesting PDI to send a service tech to do this wiring on one unit and ABB/contractor will complete the remaining 23 units on their own.

123,"Notes from customer not happy with how JCOMM is working Hello, To say that the information and functionality of our new PDIq WaveStar Hub is disappointing is probably generous. The unit itself as installed on the wall is very frustrating to use. The responsiveness of the touchscreen is horrifically slow and non-responsive. Java incompatibility of the GUI, firmware issues between the Jcomm units and the hub, (same with the hub and new overhead busway system in another location), all makes for a very disappointing result for the tens of thousands of dollars spent. The team that monitors the power says it is easier to go to the PDU√≠s themselves that to use the slow GUI interface. There is no charting of power consumption over time. A MIN/MAX circuit load is useful, but over what time period? What resets the min/max values? In a data centre we need to understand the power utilization on circuits and circuit pairs over time as the utilization can vary dramatically over busy and slow periods the day or week. A power spot check may completely miss a heavy utilization spike. Right now we cannot provide the power metrics to leadership that we expected when justifying the investment. I was used to the Liebert SiteScan tool when working at another company and I guess I expected similar results from this tool that claims to be a BCMS. It appears that we now need to export this information (SNMP) to another tool that can provide the granularity of detail. A chance google search showed me that a product called PowerMap existed in 2011. How do we get the product? Your website does not even mention it as an option. Please provide information the PowerMap tool, as that may provide the reporting we are looking for. You will probably be getting a contact from our vendor as our team has a meeting with them later today. "

I have attached the shop drawings and a picture of the tapbox I just received. How are we going to fix this? I am in a rush to get these installed soon before the equipment goes live. Perhaps the best way to solve this problem, instead of shipping the tapboxes back and forth, is to find out from PDI what 30A 400V terminal blocks they approved to be used according to their shop drawing and rush send them to me so that I can install them myself. We should definitely receive a discount on these tapboxes as they were shipped to me incomplete. "
132,Busway giving false readings 
133,From Jeff Lester: We have identified 52 out of 104 CT√≠s are not reading currents on the end feeds. Thun said these could possibly be from when we received the bad batch of CT√≠s from our vendor. If I move a known good ct over to the location on the board it works. Unfortunately the site is live and we never performed startups or commissioning on them. Customer said that we can possibly schedule a shutdown to replace these depending on availability of the new parts I re-addressed endfeeds and tested communication. We replaced a couple accumulator boards and fixed address conflicts. They currently have a end feed with a bad transformer board as fuses are not blown and it has input voltage but no output. Email and photos attached 
134,Customer reporting that (4) of their PDUs from the DC1 project are showing 0 values where they should be getting values. 
135,"PDU Communication issues From Thun: This site seems to be having multiple issues. The original issues listed most of the PDU√≠s having Comm issues. I have advised Vincent below with some possible solutions. But he is still having issues with the units. These alarms may just need to be cleared on the display. These issues may need to be looked at by a PDI technician to get resolved. The comm issues were cleared before by our technician. He brought up more issues with other units relating to the BCMS boards. I am not sure when these issues started happening. There has since been more issues reported. We are waiting to hear From Keith Waterman who will be on site this week. UPDATE FROM KEITH: Here is what I found: √Ø	√¨DISPLAY Comm. X Error√Æ on Color Touch monitor (see attached photos). These alarms are for comm error between color touch mon and BCMS (2 boards/PDU). I am still able to read all boards, so the alarm is nuisance only. I cleared all alarms on about 10 PDUs and none came back while I was on site. I was told they return at any time. BCMS boards were recently upgraded with KWH (13.xxx) and color mon software revision is 1.009. John feels that update to Mon software may require update to latest revision to correct. This error is only on the Color and not on the same configuration monochrome Wavestar. We need to resolve quickly!! √Ø	Commissioning support for 4 days 4/15-19. They are commissioning new product that week and have requested PDI commissioning support the entire time. I have quoted and Roger has promised the PO this weekend. I would like to make sure we have a qualified PDI employee (unfortunately not a 3rd party as this is a very sensitive customer) for the entire week. I know the 19th is a Holiday, so we should be able to get the commissioning done in the 4 days allotted. √Ø	Relocation of BCMS cards from inside PDU to inside side car for safety/serviceability issues. (Please see attached photo). The BCMS was located above the transformer on the side door area. Two of the units are against the wall and two others are butted together side by side. We are unable to access these boards for serviceability (programming breaker size, calibration or possible replacement upon failure). All around bad place to locate and they need to be moved to the side car for accessibility). I have provided a quote to do this, BUT, Roger, Ajith and I heard complaints from customer about them having to pay to have these relocated as they were sold on a √¨Front access only√Æ unit. Obviously they are not true front access if we have to service from the side. I spoke with Roger and Ajith regarding sensitivity of the customer and both agree this may affect further business. My suggestion is at minimum, a discounted offering to relocate the BCMS√ñif not doing free of charge. I will put this in Rich√≠s very capable hands as I know he likes giving away money!!! √Ø	Door latch will not close completely on side car: FIXED√ñcontractor did not install dead panel correctly and I removed, repaired and door closes fine now. Customer happy! √Ø	RPP showed only one panel on color touch mon√ñ.There are two panels. Unit configured for only one downstream device. I corrected in settings and Customer satisfied. "

272,"From customer: These are part of the much larger issue with the PDI JCOMM devices that are showing zero kW on random circuits. Gabe and I have been trying to get help from PDI for many weeks. We just received another email from PDI this morning which I have attached. If you follow the email chain, you will see that this has been going on for a ridiculously long time with no resolution. This is absolutely a problem that PDI needs to own and fix. Thanzeer and I have talked about this and there are a couple options we have on our end to provide kW readings for these circuits but both options are time-consuming and would hopefully only be a temporary fix. We would have to calculate the kW for each circuit either in Wonderware or SDP rather than using the provided values. I personally think this has gone way too long with very little response from PDI to actually solve the problem. We have many JCOMMs deployed at multiple sites so this problem is not just isolated to SJC. FYI, at SJC alone, we have over 1,300 circuits with this issue at last check. Since we have deployed additional circuits the number is likely much higher. If you√≠d like me to work with Thanzeer on a temporary fix, I can do that. In the mean-time, I think we need some help to escalate the severity of this problem. We have been more than patient and accommodating on our end so far. "

Tuesday (yesterday) the site performed load banking on the two RPP√≠s and 1 unit registered abnormal temps on one of the Eaton breakers. The site called me and requested torque values on the lug-breaker connections as this connection registered the abnormal temperature. He said that the lug was loose and when he spoke to the factory they said the lug should be 144 in-lbs. He was able to make a full turn on the lug until it registered appropriate torque. Should we open a case to make quality aware of these connections? Again this connection was between the lug and breaker and not cable to lug.

First, half the units showed both Line-Line Voltage (480Vac) and Line-Neutral Voltage (277Vac) while the other half did not. Pics attached. These RPP√≠s (if you can call them that) are Facebook specific and have trendpoint meters and none of our monitoring. Speaking to Thun it seems like we should have received them already set up correctly. I logged into the display (via touch screen) and also the meter base (using web interface with TCP/IP on laptop) and could not figure out how to reconfigure. The site prefers that online line-Neutral be displayed on Main screen. Also the ones that showed L-L also had setup button at the top right of screen while the ones not showing L-L did not have that setup button. I believe this issue may be firmware related but without know much about these meters it√≠s difficult to say. Please advise. Also, we have one unit with phantom currents being displayed. I was limited on troubleshooting live gear (Facebook was right on top of me) and they would not give permission to shut it back down. The unit was completely unloaded and I verified with clampon. It was showing current on all three phases and the neutral (around 150A) and I believe the meter base will need to be replaced. The wiring of the CT√≠s looked solid and I doubt all 4 CT√≠s could be failed. I have attached pics of trendpoint meter and display. "

The location is already crowded with subfeed wiring. I had this same issue at another tmobile site and we moved the terminal blocks to another less crowded interior surface. our standard design with the swing out terminal blocks, breaks the connector off of the board because of clearance problems. He can replace the boards on these (2) PDUs, and slide the terminal blocks down for clearance, but we need to change the design and/or build of these in the future. Exposed threads on screws are also nicking the cable jacket on the same T-Mobile units. Again, basic clearance issues with the swing out terminal blocks. This is being found during startup, so we√≠ve got the customer on hold while we ship out new boards, and Tommy will have to figure it out on the nicked cables. "

764,"From Customer: in 2016, we experienced a critical load failure in a PDI PDU-equipped suite when PDU output breakers tripped. Load on the unit was high, but within spec and no fault had occurred. It turned out that the particular breakers used, in the specific configuration provided, were not operating in the range within which they can be counted on not to trip falsely. We worked out a fix plan with PDI and negotiated a cost/PDU to address all affected units. The fix comes in two versions √± swap out the sidecar completely, or rebuild it in place. The best choice varies from one PDU to the next due to proximity to other equipment √± which affects access, what√≠s installed nearby under the raised floor, and other factors. Therefore, the first step when we select the next suites in which to carry out the fix is to survey the suite with the site team, a PDI tech, and an electrical contractor present. The √¨output√Æ of the survey is an agreement as to which version of the fix will be used for each PDU. Once this is determined, we then go ahead and order the gear from PDI accordingly. "

767,"From customer: Need your assistance in resolving SJC JCOMM BCM systems that are randomly reporting zero kW on circuits pulling amps. See email below. Let me know when you are available to talk. See attached emails below. From customer: This issue was first discovered approximately a month ago and I sent out the attached email internally. We did a verification all the way back to the gateway reading the JCOMM data. Eric Raduenz also ran report to give us every circuit at SJC reading zero kW while pulling amps and found well over 1300 circuits exhibiting this problem. This does appear to be a widespread issue since it has been observed on multiple panels including the one in the snapshot below which is our most recent installation (bad values in red boxes and good values in blue box). Unfortunately, the panel has very little customer load at this time so it is more difficult to see the problem. I went and checked our deployment of JCOMM in DFW1 and unfortunately, none of those panels have any customer load so we cannot initially verify that they too have the same issue. Unfortunately, these checks that we have done so far only cover circuits that are pulling power. It would require applying a load to each circuit to do a 100% verification. I√≠m happy to provide any other information that will help us understand this problem and resolve it since we are currently adding even more of these JCOMM BCMs at other locations. "

On April 8th Mark Czarniak the Director of Client Power & Electrical Install sent an email in reference to a circuit breaker that had melted in a PDI PDU. Mark√≠s email states, √¨Since the hot spot was on the √¨C√Æ phase line side, the only place torqueing could have possibly come into play is where the base is bolted to the bussing, or possible something inside either the breaker or base. This was abrand-new feeder install, with a breaker from this 2012 era newly installed in this particular position, unused previously taken from a different breaker slot in this unit. The breaker seemed to be seated correctly with the screws holding the breaker to the base secured, but it is unknown if this may have played a factor in all this or not. Upon loosening the bolts securing the base to the bussing nothing abnormal was noticed. Everything energized with no issues initially when first commissioned and energized on 3/25/19. The customer went under load on 4/6/19 around 10pm, and between 3am and 4am on 4/7/19 there was a noticeable smell of burning plastic which brought this issue to light.√Æ Switch returned breaker which was received on May 22nd (Square D DGN36400E20) from unit T12-18-US-S-0826 for a Root Cause Investigation due to the breaker melting on-site.

This caused a high resistance and thermal event on the phase and softened/melted the polymer. 2)	Because this is built on two separate U-Channels the masts must be well aligned and tested for this alignment. The field had 1 side well aligned and engaged, and the other side would not engage due to the butterflies on the mast cams interfering with the rail penetration until properly seated. Looks like the knob was forced and the cam actuator rods were broken for both rods. 3)	Once the second mast was cam√≠d, the screw to support the knob in the slider backed out and became stuck. This is a reoccurring issue with the screw backing out on the slider. Suggest engineering look into this. "

These readings were compared to the readings on the display and if any readings were off a 2% tolerance, they were calibrated on the unit. Found one issue with unit RPP A5.

1239,"They are utilizing PDI 400kVA PDUs and RPPs. This concern is regarding the PDI 400kVA PDU in particular. There is perforated metal sheet metal on the sides of the cabinet, along with large gaps underneath the PDU Stand. This causes Raised Floor Air, which is intended for the I.T. Cabinets, to leak into and out the bottom of the PDU Cabinet. While I did not take measurements, past experience has shown this can be 2000-3000 cfm. Multiplied by four PDUs, this equates to around 8,000-12,000 cfm, which is between 33-50% of the output air of an entire CRAC unit (40 Ton CRACs are rated at 24,000 cfm each). You may or may not recall we ran into this problem with the 300kVA SPDUs at T5√ñlarge penetrations in the SPDU Stands leaking air. We√≠ve since corrected this after asking PDI whether the PDU Transformers are cooled convectively, with above-floor ambient air. PDI confirmed that they are. My question: are these 400 kVA units cooled the same way? Convectively? If so, we need to seal up the top of the PDU Stands to prevent raised floor air loss. Unfortunately, I believe Inglett and Stubbs, the Electrical Contractor, has the Submittals on the PDUs, so I cannot run this answer down myself. I would like to ask you to please inquire with your engineering teams at the factory, and get an answer back to me. BTW some skirting was provided by either PDI or Inglett which wrapped around the base of the PDU. It did not have a good aesthetic appearance, and will not solve the problem, as Raised Floor air will flow up into the PDU Cabinet and out through the perforated metal. The bottom really needs to be sealed at the 4√Æ seal-tite conduits to do this correctly. "

1362,"As you requested, we were on-site Saturday, February 24, 2018, to review and observe the PDU circuit board replacements performed by PDI field-service technicians. A.	The circuit board component replacement affected critical equipment the following equipment and (Stakeholder Group): 1.	PDU-N1 (ECMS) 2.	PDU-N2 (ECMS) 3.	PDU-N3 (SS-IT) 4.	PDU-N4 (SS-IT) 5.	PDU-N5 (OPPS Ctl Centers) 6.	PDU-N6 (OPPS Ctl Centers) 7.	BOH-STS-1 (B2 Facilities Back-of-House) B.	Generally, the work was completed without any significant problems and within the previously-anticipated time-frame. C.	However, it should be noted that, due to the lack of required machine screw fasteners being shipped with the replacement circuit board mounting plates, OPC and Partitions were able to step-in furnish the necessary mounting hardware (from attic stock) for PDI to use thus avoiding the need for PDI technicians to leave the site to visit a local hardware supply and procure the necessary fasteners. The hardware is a very minor cost item but a potential for huge aggravation when working during off normal hours. D.	In addition, the following condition was discovered and require follow-up repair by PDI Service. 1.	Upon removal of voltage from PDU-N1 (Source S2 Input from CDB), the MHI display screen indicated a voltage of approximately 200V remaining on the S2 input Phase B and Phase C. Source S2 supply was in the required secure L-O/T-O position. 2.	The PDI technician believes the voltage indication, on what should have been a √¨zero-volt√Æ dead bus, is caused by a deteriorated internal capacitor bank connected to the static transfer switch (STS). The capacitors are field-replicable and will require another shut-down for the replacement work. 3.	PDI did not anticipate the present condition was an √¨immediate√Æ need (today) repair item. 4.	Also, it is not known if the PDU capacitors are an item recommended for replacement at certain in-service time intervals (like the capacitors in the UPS). PDI is supposed to advise on recommended replacement at the earliest. 5.	Regardless, it is recommended to have the capacitor components replaced at the earliest before a catastrophic failure (capacitors can burst) occurs. 6.	Will need, and will request, information from PDI to determine if √¨all√Æ STS√≠s need immediate replacement capacitors. "

1460,"Attached you will find a list of the boxes we had to recover and fix yesterday. Im not 100% sure this list is complete as a few were repaired onsite and mixed around a little. The customer initially brought to our attention that some of his equipment was not working correctly. They were showing an alarm on their rack mount PDU strips. The customer then took a standard residential type electrical outlet tester and plugged it into the 5-15R2 receptacles on the bottom of the TOBs. Most, if not all were showing an open ground. After arriving onsite I explained that the √¨teeth√Æ of the TOB is what is supposed to connect the bus ground to the TOBs. I had brought an example of a tap off box that we had at the office. As soon as I set the box on the table we could tell there was a difference in √¨teeth√Æ subcomponent of the TOB. But we continued to trouble shoot. The only way we could get the customers TOBs to ground properly were to jame the TOB into the bus as hard as possible, and rock it back and forth to tr to scuff up the bottom of the bus. And only then did it sometimes make a ground. The customer felt this was unsatisfactory. 2nd smaller issue. We discovered with a continuity tester that the second rail after the splice pack didn√≠t even have ground. I suspected the little stickers that ship on top of the rails at the very ends were still on (because those stickers are pretty hard to see, I would suggest they get printed on bright yellow or green material instead of see through). Upon inspection I did not see the stickers, but I cleaned off the bare aluminum best I could and then really torqued down on the screws that hold on the top plate. After that there seemed to be a good connection. Im not sure how, but I feel like there should be a better means to make sure that ground is made properly. The customer is already behind setting up this little lab section. He was adamant we get the un-groundable TOBs corrected as soon as possible. We both felt that the √¨teeth√Æ were the culprit. Instead of waiting a week or so to ship the units back and forth and get new teeth on them, we decided we would start disassembling a stack of TOBs we happen to have in our office since that customer asked us to hold on to them until they were ready for them. We removed all the teeth from the Netscout TOBs, and replaced them with teeth from the order that is meant for American Airlines. "

1577,"Hello all, Just to update everyone on this thread. We found the cause of the phase rotation issue. That signal is driven from the input voltage sensing of the unit. When I measured that voltage I found phase C was lower than normal. Suspecting an issue with the fuse, I traced the signal back and noted some damage to the input voltage sensing wires of the PDU. This would account for false indication of rotation. Unfortunately we cannot fix the issue with the unit live. The termination is directly in contact with the main breaker line side. We will require a shut down of the PDU to resolve. I have attached pics of the damaged wires. The result of no fixing this issue immediately should be minor. You will get input voltage alarms/rotation and possible frequency alarms. The unit should provide power normally though. We discussed onsite and there may be some loads that need switching. I also told Kurino that we would bring a new board in case the repair requires that as well. Please reach out to us for coordination once you establish a time to shut down PDUA08. We will need several week√≠s notice to establish schedule. "

1645,"From Customer: Good afternoon Thun, Can you please help me out with getting part information and repair procedures for these deficiencies found during the last maintenance cycle? The attached images are for the deficiencies found for the CT plugs and wires on the M4G board. We would need to know the repair procedure for this board and partial wire harness/plug replacement. The B4 PDU has CTs that were disconnected and not shorted so at the recommendation of the techs, those CTs are most likely bad now and would need to be replaced. Could you also provide a repair procedure for the CT replacement so we can determine when we would be able to schedule the PDU for repair? The QC4 PDU BC1 is another one high on the priority list since the TVSS is currently bad along with the fuse block. Could you please include the repair procedures for this? From Keith Waterman: I spoke with both Jeff and Vince as they did the PM. Yes the M4-G boards will have to be replaced and the connector will be cut off and replaced with new. Wire will be cut back to remove damaged insulation, then reterminated. The fuse block feeding the TVSS and TVSS itself will have to be replaced as there is a short inside the existing TVSS that caused fuses to blow and damage to fuse block. The subfeed CTs were never terminated to a BCMS resistor board as there is no BCMS or Resistor card on the unit. I don√≠ know if it was removed or never ordered with, but it is strange that the unit would be installed with CTS on the output breakers without this circuitry. I√≠ll look at the SN to see if it was originally configured with monitoring. "

What your hearing could sound more amplified or pronounced due to it vibrating at a different frequency than you are used to hearing from the 208v units. In rare cases, excessive noise can be an indicator of improper lamination bonding during manufacturing, but those are typically so loud that you just ""know"" when you turn it on. This would have also been caught at the factory during the multiple times the transformer is energized prior to it hitting your site. By way of copying Drew on this message I will engage the factory about this but they're probably going to want to hear it in person before making any proclamations one way or the other. "

2195,"From Tommy: So when I went out there to update to the BETA software, (April 15) and had serious issues. The monitors would go into a reboot cycle and nothing I did made them work. I then reloaded 1.015 with no problems. I believe ATS is causing the issue but I don√≠t know enough about networking to figure it out. I√≠m happy to entertain any thoughts on how to proceed. I know we recently put out a CTS issue with the web viewer and this may be related but I can√≠t be sure. My MicroSD card reader may be the issue but like I said, 1.015 loaded perfectly fine. Below is an example of the CTS cycling with the BETA installed. Download Attachment Available until Jul 10, 2019 If you read below there√≠s really been two separate issues regarding comms. The first one happened when the site was √¨writing√Æ to the BCMS boards. They would periodically scan our addresses for breaker sizes and thresholds, and if it saw something different, the BMS would √¨write√Æ. It cause the COMM 2 alarm on PDU√≠s (subfeed current) or any channel on the RPP√≠s. When I asked them to turn write function off then the problem went away. That was happening more frequently. Afterward they noticed that Displays wouldn√≠t respond to touch to wake up and the ethernet port was not connecting anymore. I tried doing mdscan to a unit and pulling up the web interface and got no activity. I push the reset and the unit comes back online. Below is a sequence of what screens I found bad and when. 1/25 I had 5 screens RPP 3B3-1 RPP 3C9-2 PDU 3B10 PDU 3A9 RPP 3C9-1 2/14 I had 3 screens RPP 3C2-1 RPP 3A9-2 PDU 3C9 On 2/22 Mark Reported PDU 3A2 And today we have PDU 3A8 PDU 3A9 RPP 3B10-2 So we have a total of 16 PDU√≠s and 32 RPP√≠s. That√≠s 48 color touch screens in the Data Hall. At a frequency of 1 failure per week or so, the next one to √¨fail√Æ is unpredictable. I√≠m happy to go there and collect data, but at this point I√≠m not sure what else to do. I had the site investigate the polling rates and nothing looked to frequent. If a PDU has multiple addresses they they could conceivable be pulling different devices at the same time on the same CTS but that√≠s just a guess. "

So last night I got to thinking staff stated they thought it took to long for the generator power to kick in, I did not go down there but after speaking with Ryan this morning he said there was a loud popping noise for a few seconds. This morning I went to the UPS room to see if the STS√≠s transferred and looking at them I do not think STS #2 transferred it is still showing 2 transfer from way back, however STS #1 is showing 4 transfers. The building ran great with no issues from the power. Chad I know you went to the UPS room did you look at the STS during this happening? "

I asked him what he was doing and he stated he was performing out of phase transfers. Again when he got to 120 degrees out of phase, then this is where the issue happened. The buses on the sub feed breakers showed burned marks. See pics This unit has already been through 4 hours of burn in and thermal readings have already been taken. The electricians could not find any issues with the load bank or the load bank wires. I fully checked the STS for any other shorts and damages and found none. None in the PCB cabinet or on the SCR. I also checked the PDU transformer and all the connections. No other shorts could be found. Possible cause could have been loose bolts on the output buss. I shook the bus bar then they were loose. But this could have been cause after the short. Not sure. Attached are the logs from each unit and the plots for today. During the meeting this morning, unit G15-6 has been ruled out by the commissioning team of causing any issues to the ups. The unit we still need to repair is E15-1. The subfeed distribution shorted.

2323,Information from site: . My electricians showed me a small problem that needs to be corrected before the panels are energized. I have attached a couple of pictures that show the breaker rack for one of the vertical power panels. Un like a standard panel where the breakers are split 24 on one side all odd number and 24 on the other side all even number these panels are in a single line with 42 breaker slots in a single row. What the picture shows are the three phase strips that the breakers bolt to. The center one is offset to allow the other phase strips to connect to the individual breakers. The offset phase strip need a spacer to keep from shorting out the other phase strips. The problem is the spacer is missing in the breaker slot 41. The green screw is a place holder because there is a plastic spacer behind the strip to prevent a short circuit and the screw is holding it in position

Both of the transformers are damaged exactly like in the first picture. The packaging was not enough to keep these parts safe. As you can see in the last picture, the part was falling right out of the bottom of the box which is why the mounting hole is damaged on both parts.

2503,"various issues for Dell Plano, TX shipments. there are pictures for each of the items. picture is inside the email attached. Issue 1 : Action Item #1 What the hex is under this heat shrink tube. We need to know. here√≠s why we need to know: During load bank testing, an IR gun showed this little section to be over 270 degrees Fahrenheit on every single end feed. All other sections appeared to be normal temperatures expect for whatever is behind this piece of shrink tube. Is this a concern for PDI? Is that the way it√≠s supposed to operate? What is its function? Issue 2 Action Item #2 USB service port on the undersize of end feed accumulator box. This seems like an awesome idea, haven√≠t seen it in the past but I√≠m glad it√≠s on there now. One big issue though√ñ..it was only installed on 6 of the total 10 boxes that were shipped out. (I√≠m guessing the 4 without them came from SO 24252?) We need to provide cables and services to put it in the other 4 empty spaces. Also on the 4 end feeds that were missing USB service cables, they were also all missing PDI stickers, and two with the USB cables were missing stickers too. To make a long story short, we need six sets of PDI PowerWave Stickers, and 4 sets of USB services ports installed. Issue 3 Action Item #3 One of the end feeds was shipped out with what I would consider a female BCMS connector, the other nine end feeds had male ends in them. All the starter rails were shipped out with female connectors. We need someone to swap out the connector of the wrong end feed in the field please. Issue 4 Action Item #4 One of the BCMS rail cables were accidently pitched and severed while the load bank end feed connection boxes were being used. Dell and contractor are both pretty sure they did that and it was not shipped out from the factory that way. The good news it√≠s at the very very end of the rail, and there is absolutely no plans in the future to expand these lengths, so I think, it shouldn√≠t affect any downstream connections. What we need answered is what do you want Dell/Entech to do, should they just cap the wire with a piece of heat shrink? should they try to strip back the wire and fix it back to the connector? Does PDI Field services fix it? will it still work the way it is now? Issue 5 Action Item #5 During the initial load banking, Entech was able to access all the BCMS Cards in the end feeds. Good news is they were able to see voltage and current at every single CT. Bad news is they were way off. Which is probably expected? please confirm Each set of CTs had to be calibrated from the 500+ amps they were showing, down to the 345 ish amps of known load. Not a huge problem since Entech has been trained on how to do that with your software, however, now there are VERY CONCERNED about the calibration of the CTs in each of their tap off boxes. They do not want to load bank and calibrate each tap off box, but are thinking they may have to if we cannot produce something to easy their worries. They would like to know if there is any sort of calibration or testing that goes on at the factory before these ships out, or if there is any document that will ensure each of their CT strips are to conform to a certain level of accuracy. Issue 6 Action Item #6 Can we schedule Startup for some time the first week of august? I know there are service dollars available from SO 24252. If that tech is going to be fixing some of the communication connections on site we may actually want to get him out there sooner rather than later before they turn all the loads on permanently and are unable to work on the equipment hot. But by the end of the first week of august, there will be live load with a few tap off boxes in each rail that the startup tech can help Entech with addressing, labeling, communication stuff ect√ñ... It would also be good if the tech can help them with some issues they have with their BCMS on their RPPs√ñbut that√≠s really a whole different deal we need to tackle later. Issue 7 (non) Action Items Some of the CTs shipped out as black SqD√ñ.some as white some other brand I don√≠t remember. What will be supplied in future? also, just wanted to bring it to factories attention, the last starter rail that we shipped out in a hurry was shipped out with the incorrect screws that are meant for the PT wires. The threads of the screw did not match the bus bar. Not a huge issue since home depot happened to have the screws that were needed, just thought I would bring it to attention since I had the picture and this email already typed out. "

2555,One of the doors in missing a Hinge and the door fell off as soon as it was opened. See attached picture for an example of the √¨Hinge√Æ type that is missing. All of the Grounding Bars are in the wrong location. They were put in the feeder area of the RPP and not the Circuit Panel area. See attached picture √¨Ground Bus√Æ. All of the Stands came with the welded bolts to place the RPPs onto. The RPPs came without any holes drilled for mounting. This will create a lot of extra work and mess that should not have been needed. The Circuit Panels have been wired incorrectly from the last set we received and quite honestly doesn√≠t make any sense. On the Front panel side the first panel is on the right side and the second panel is on the left (In my opinion this would be backwards). On the Back panel side the first panel is on the right side and the second panel is on the left unless it is a three panel unit in which the first panel is on the left side???? Really inconsistent. Circuit Panels do not have a way to differentiate what panel is what. All 3 or 4 circuit panels are labeled with circuit 1-42 without any other defining nomenclature. I know this had been specified on prior projects to no avail though so it should not be surprising. Also as in all other RPPs received prior the Neutral Bus is built in a way that makes using only 1 of the bars possible. They are installed opposite of the way the manufacture intended. The √¨Hinge√Æ item should be taken care of when PDI is onsite (They will need at a minimum a hinge pin and retaining clip).

Additionally the Xpress DR+ had the Lantronix default firmware installed on all eight of the busways, 6.1 instead of the required 3.2, which prevented the Lantronix device from accepting the appropriate settings for Modbus conversions.

We would like a copy of all testing report from the factory and report on correction made to the transformer. While performing our initial inspections of PDU √± Unit No. 2 (Serial No. 112-0094) transformer testing, it was noticed that the transformer year of manufacturer date was 2017. Upon further inspection, I noticed the transformer itself is titled towards the rear of the PDU enclosure. This is the same issue we had one year on 05/01/2018 during the ATL 1.5 project. In that instance, it was reported to PDI that the tilted transformer was unsatisfactory, and a replacement unit was sent out. After reviewing documentation from last year√≠s test results and comparing it with the nameplate of the transformer for PDU √± Unit No. 2 onsite, it was noticed that the serial numbers match. (Transformer Serial Number E17-51-02590). It appears that PDI sent out the same √¨unsatisfactory√Æ transformer from last year√≠s project in a different enclosure.

2768,"Narrative: One of Switch√≠s CIOPS personnel was doing a walkthrough of their critical infrastructure in the power spine and smelled burning plastic. They quickly narrowed down the source to the PDU in question. The load on the breaker was noted at 70A, the PDU was de-energized and opened up. The pictures show the DLO phase wiring from the breaker base up to the top hat to be overheating and causing melting of the plastic around the lug termination. The temperature at the time of shut down was 300F. Once the PDU cooled, the technicians tried to pull/wiggle the DLO wiring to determine if it was loose. It was not. Next, they checked torque of the mechanical lug and found that to be tight as well. They continued to dissemble the unit to remove the breaker base, snapping pictures as they did. No loose terminations on the bus or breaker base were found. However, they did check the existing bolts for their torque values and found a variety of numbers from the high 20√≠s to 40 ft. lbs. Picture 1: Close up of the mechanical connection from the DLO cable into the mechanical lug. Picture 2: Close up of mechanical lug where the DLO cable enters the breaker base.

Have the breaker and base forensically analyzed to determine root cause of the failure. 2. Provide the published torque values for all hardware in the PDU√≠s and RPP√≠s so that Switch can field verify before putting units into service 3.

2813,"During rounds there was an alarm on the display of PDU B5 indicating low output voltage on source 2. I scrolled through the digital display and verified that the S2 transformer output readings were at 0. I opened the door on the F feeder side and noticed that the source 2 input breaker was in the tripped position. The PDU display is showing S2 input voltage of 480 and also S2 input voltage available on the system status panel. The tripped input breaker is on the 480 side of the transformer so the monitoring of the input voltage must be occurring on the line side of the S2 input breaker prior to feeding the transformer. There was no alarm on the active alarm screen on continuum associated with PDU B5. I checked the PDU main power display on andover for PDU B5 and it is showing updated information of voltage and amperage and bypass status reflecting its current condition but is also flashing a loss of communication alarm. I have attached a photo of the B5 PDU info from the andover screen of its current condition. The alarm on the actual PDU display was alarm since last clear low output voltage source 2.

2886,"Issue one: notes from tommy - Hello Mohammed, I√≠m in the field supporting commissioning on 20 Infinity PDU√≠s. I have had some issues that I√≠ve worked through but there is a single issue that I need some help with. PDU S/N 112-0056-17 The display is communicating locally/remotely and all functions seem to work correctly with the exception of the LED directly below the touchscreen. I suspected that the micro SD card has some issue. I removed the control power and swapped the SD card with another unit, and the LED started working again. I put the original card back in the display. I√≠d like to get your input on a possible cause and see if you could supply me with the correct files to store on the SD card. I have attached pics from the display and of our label. Issue two: notes from tommy - spread sheet attached Spent most of the day working at Serverfarm on the Infinity startups/commissioning. We have 26 issues assigned to us onsite that will require some sort of resolution to move forward. I√≠ve explained to them that the software issues is a priority for us and we have people on it, with some resolution soon. Total issues are 26 as I said with 10 related to these software glitches/resets, 1 is a fuse I need to replace (I√≠ll try to source locally), CT strip issues (may be software but they appear to be bad CT√≠s), and we also had some breakers trip during load bank burn in today. The breakers tripping were likely due to high ambient temps in the room. Cooling has been locking up during burnins and the ambient got over 95deg during the two hour burn in. Surface temps on the breakers exceeded 120 deg F. We had 4 pdu√≠s that had tripped breakers. We reset and restarted burn in. After burnin we also let the room cool for 2 hrs and reloaded only those breakers to just under max capacity for 2 additional hours. No further tripping. We have a significant number of ct strips not registering currents. By my count we have tested 40 panel boards (10 pdus, so half of them) and I have missing currents on at least 12 CT strips. There may be more as I was rushing to get the testing done but also trying to get pics and notes. I√≠ll supply more detail on this tomorrow. I have also run an ISSUE report and formatted it for excel which I am attaching for your review. I only have two more days there before IST so issue resolution is gonna be difficult since we have about 10 more units to test. "

This parts compliment will allow them to rebuild this PDU and make it whole again. 2.	They have removed this melted breaker base and have it in a controlled setting complete with the burned cable still in its lug as shown in the pictures. They would like a call tag to send it back to the factory for a root cause analysis as to why it happened (again). 3.	We need to put together a √´spare parts kit√≠ for Switch that includes (3) breaker bases and (1) full set of cables from the bases to the top hat termination points so that they have it on hand for the inevitable next time that this happens.

2935,"Notes from technician As you may have heard I had an issue at a site here in Brewster Washington yesterday. I was onsite only to start up a standalone sts but the customer requested that I look at another issue. I discussed with Sarah and she said to help them out with an inspection but to inform her if something significant needs to occur. I arrived and found that the STS was online supporting load from source 2. There was a phase rotation alarm on the STS from source 2. The site stated that Kelly Ryan performed the startup in April but at that time they had only pulled the power in (single source) to source 1 and that the two were jumpered together. First think I checked was the voltage drop between the two. The phase indication on the display stated that there as only 2deg between phases but I measured A-A:120vac, B-B:12vac, and C-C:240vac. They are aware there is a phase shift between the two sources and are working to resolve that issue in their power distribution. In the course of inspecting the unit I noted first that there were screws in the bottom of the SCR logic tray. I then inspected the three circuit boards (SAS,Pulse,Gate Drive) and the SAS had two bottom screws missing and the Pulse appeared to have no screws supporting it. I asked the customer to place the unit in Bypass but since they didn√≠t obtain permission they said I could not take the load off 2 source protection. I should have told them that I could not move forward, but I decided to try and inspect the board further. Due to the plugs and ribbon cable I wasn√≠t 100% sure that no screws were supporting the board. I put on 40 cal arc flash top and gloves and tried to pull the board away from the standoffs. The rear of the board made contact with the bottom left standoff and shorted the rear pins to ground. I saw an arc on the left side of the board and looked up at the display. The unit showed shut down with several alarms. I immediately informed the customer (they were right behind me the whole time) and requested to reenergize the load from bypass on source 2. He told me to proceed. The input supply to source 2 had tripped, it was reset and shut. I showed voltage available on S2 and energized the output. The customer then proceeded with their equipment recovery which took about 20 minutes. I called Sarah and John and informed them of the load loss. I also started to inspect the unit further (de-energized the SAS, Pulse, Gate drive) to determine the extent of the damage. The Pulse board was removed and there was obvious damage to the rear from the short. I also found all three phases of the S2 scrs reading on 14 ohms and A phase of S1 also shorted. I do not know the status of the snubber boards. I then proceeded to the STS I was there to startup. Please see attached report for the Incident. The customer is obviously anxious to get repairs done but I told them that we needed to shut the unit down for repair. They stated that would be an issue and could we repair with the unit energized and I told them that would not be advisable. I have received an email from Jason Weidauer JWeidauer@ldpassociates.com already asking for an update on a repair timeline. I told him we would update as soon as possible. I have attached few pics and wish I had gotten more but the situation moved pretty fast once I shorted the board. Eddy also asked for my report as soon as possible so if we could release today, I think that may help move things forward. "
