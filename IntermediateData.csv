61,"URBACON is looking to change all breakers to have 400AT, and I believe the initial understanding was that all breaker wiring was to be set to accommodate 400AT too. 

From Ajith: 
Urbacon is GE√≠s customer and Microsoft is the end user. Customer is changing the 250A trip plug from 400A trip plugs for all three CBs in all PDUs. This means 3X 5ft long 3/O wire needs to be added to each breaker. ABB and the contractor will buy the breaker and CTs for the modification. What they need from us is 72X 5ft long 3/O wires and associated lugs/hardware. I have listed below the materials given by engineering. GE/ABB also requesting PDI to send a service tech to do this wiring on one unit and ABB/contractor will complete the remaining 23 units on their own. They are doing this to expedite the work as PDU work is the only remaining item.",0,5004600000959u0AAA,"URBACON is looking to change all breakers to have 400AT, and I believe the initial understanding was that all breaker wiring was to be set to accommodate 400AT too.

Hello,
   To say that the information and functionality of our new PDIq WaveStar Hub is disappointing is probably generous.  
The unit itself as installed on the wall is very frustrating to use.  The responsiveness of the touchscreen is horrifically slow and non-responsive.  
Java incompatibility of the GUI, firmware issues between the Jcomm units and the hub, (same with the hub and new overhead busway system in another location), all makes for a very disappointing result for the tens of thousands of dollars spent.   The team that monitors the power says it is easier to go to the PDU√≠s themselves that to use the slow GUI interface.  

There is no charting of power consumption over time.  A MIN/MAX circuit load is useful, but over what time period?  What resets the min/max values?   In a data centre we need to understand the power utilization on circuits and circuit pairs over time as the utilization can vary dramatically over busy and slow periods the day or week.  A power spot check may completely miss a heavy utilization spike. Right now we cannot provide the power metrics to leadership that we expected when justifying the investment.  I was used to the Liebert SiteScan tool when working at another company and I guess I expected similar results from this tool that claims to be a BCMS.  It appears that we now need to export this information (SNMP) to another tool that can provide the granularity of detail.  

A chance google search showed me that a product called PowerMap existed in 2011. How do we get the product?  Your website does not even mention it as an option.  
Please provide information the PowerMap tool, as that may provide the reporting we are looking for.

135,"PDU Communication issues 

From Thun: This site seems to be having multiple issues.

The original issues listed most of the PDU√≠s having Comm issues. I have advised Vincent below with some possible solutions. But he is still having issues with the units. These alarms may just need to be cleared on the display.

These issues may need to be looked at by a PDI technician to get resolved. The comm issues were cleared before by our technician.

He brought up more issues with other units relating to the BCMS boards. I am not sure when these issues started happening. 

There has since been more issues reported. We are waiting to hear From Keith Waterman who will be on site this week.

UPDATE FROM KEITH:

Here is what I found:
√Ø	√¨DISPLAY Comm. X Error√Æ on Color Touch monitor (see attached photos). These alarms are for comm error between color touch mon and BCMS (2 boards/PDU). I am still able to read all boards, so the alarm is nuisance only. I cleared all alarms on about 10 PDUs and none came back while I was on site. I was told they return at any time. BCMS boards were recently upgraded with KWH (13.xxx) and color mon software revision is 1.009. John feels that update to Mon software may require update to latest revision to correct. This error is only on the Color and not on the same configuration monochrome Wavestar. We need to resolve quickly!!
√Ø	Commissioning support for 4 days 4/15-19. They are commissioning new product that week and have requested PDI commissioning support the entire time. I have quoted and Roger has promised the PO this weekend. I would like to make sure we have a qualified PDI employee (unfortunately not a 3rd party as this is a very sensitive customer) for the entire week. I know the 19th is a Holiday, so we should be able to get the commissioning done in the 4 days allotted.
√Ø	Relocation of BCMS cards from inside PDU to inside side car for safety/serviceability issues. (Please see attached photo). The BCMS was located above the transformer on the side door area. Two of the units are against the wall and two others are butted together side by side. We are unable to access these boards for serviceability (programming breaker size, calibration or possible replacement upon failure). All around bad place to locate and they need to be moved to the side car for accessibility). I have provided a quote to do this, BUT, Roger, Ajith and I heard complaints from customer about them having to pay to have these relocated as they were sold on a √¨Front access only√Æ unit. Obviously they are not true front access if we have to service from the side. I spoke with Roger and Ajith regarding sensitivity of the customer and both agree this may affect further business. My suggestion is at minimum, a discounted offering to relocate the BCMS√ñif not doing free of charge. I will put this in Rich√≠s very capable hands as I know he likes giving away money!!!

We just received another email from PDI this morning which I have attached. If you follow the email chain, you will see that this has been going on for a ridiculously long time with no resolution. This is absolutely a problem that PDI needs to own and fix.

Thanzeer and I have talked about this and there are a couple options we have on our end to provide kW readings for these circuits but both options are time-consuming and would hopefully only be a temporary fix. We would have to calculate the kW for each circuit either in Wonderware or SDP rather than using the provided values.

I personally think this has gone way too long with very little response from PDI to actually solve the problem. We have many JCOMMs deployed at multiple sites so this problem is not just isolated to SJC. FYI, at SJC alone, we have over 1,300 circuits with this issue at last check. Since we have deployed additional circuits the number is likely much higher.

If you√≠d like me to work with Thanzeer on a temporary fix, I can do that. In the mean-time, I think we need some help to escalate the severity of this problem.

Tuesday (yesterday) the site performed load banking on the two RPP√≠s and 1 unit registered abnormal temps on one of the Eaton breakers.  The site called me and requested torque values on the lug-breaker connections as this connection registered the abnormal temperature.  He said that the lug was loose and when he spoke to the factory they said the lug should be 144 in-lbs.  He was able to make a full turn on the lug until it registered appropriate torque.  Should we open a case to make quality aware of these connections?  Again this connection was between the lug and breaker and not cable to lug.

You recently installed an M4DCM Board SA-PCB0049 on or around August 30, 2017.

This device was intended to allow us to gain access to the touch points in the PDU for monitoring (e.g  KVA).
(See attached photos of the various Display screens on the front of one of the units).
I acquired a MIB (attached) that was supposed to allow us to use SNMP to see into the units for monitoring.

The tool we are using is Optimum Path√≠s Visual Data Center.

Looking at the MIB file, it shows that I should be able to get Total KVA from reg 28.

                                ::= { vars 29 }

When I try using iReasoing MIB Browser I get a value of √¨0√Æ for reg28.

when they do a MIB walk using visual data center they do not get readings.

Additionally, once a fourth tap off box was added one of the other tap off boxes in the system would stop communicating. PDI√≠s service tech had stated that this was also attributed to a pinched line and that the communication bus should be replaced.

2.    A4_9    When PDI came out to do their investigation on A phase busway. They had replaced the CT board and were able to read both B & C phases. It was determined that the bad readings from our original CT could have been caused by a manufacturing error.

First, half the units showed both Line-Line Voltage (480Vac) and Line-Neutral Voltage (277Vac) while the other half did not.  Pics attached.  These RPP√≠s (if you can call them that) are Facebook specific and have trendpoint meters and none of our monitoring.  Speaking to Thun it seems like we should have received them already set up correctly.  I logged into the display (via touch screen) and also the meter base (using web interface with TCP/IP on laptop) and could not figure out how to reconfigure.  The site prefers that online line-Neutral be displayed on Main screen.  Also the ones that showed L-L also had setup button at the top right of screen while the ones not showing L-L did not have that setup button.  I believe this issue may be firmware related but without know much about these meters it√≠s difficult to say.  Please advise.

Also, we have one unit with phantom currents being displayed.  I was limited on troubleshooting live gear (Facebook was right on top of me) and they would not give permission to shut it back down.  The unit was completely unloaded and I verified with clampon.  It was showing current on all three phases and the neutral (around 150A) and I believe the meter base will need to be replaced.

We worked out a fix plan with PDI and negotiated a cost/PDU to address all affected units.

The best choice varies from one PDU to the next due to proximity to other equipment √± which affects access, what√≠s installed nearby under the raised floor, and other factors.

767,"From customer: Need your assistance in resolving SJC  JCOMM BCM systems that are randomly reporting zero kW on circuits pulling amps. See email below. Let me know when you are available to talk. 

See attached emails below.

From customer: This issue was first discovered approximately a month ago and I sent out the attached email internally. We did a verification all the way back to the gateway reading the JCOMM data. Eric Raduenz also ran report to give us every circuit at SJC reading zero kW while pulling amps and found well over 1300 circuits exhibiting this problem. This does appear to be a widespread issue since it has been observed on multiple panels including the one in the snapshot below which is our most recent installation (bad values in red boxes and good values in blue box). Unfortunately, the panel has very little customer load at this time so it is more difficult to see the problem. I went and checked our deployment of JCOMM in DFW1 and unfortunately, none of those panels have any customer load so we cannot initially verify that they too have the same issue. Unfortunately, these checks that we have done so far only cover circuits that are pulling power. It would require applying a load to each circuit to do a 100% verification. I√≠m happy to provide any other information that will help us understand this problem and resolve it since we are currently adding even more of these JCOMM BCMs at other locations.",0,5004600000A1rW3AAJ,"From customer: Need your assistance in resolving SJC JCOMM BCM systems that are randomly reporting zero kW on circuits pulling amps.

1239,"They are utilizing PDI 400kVA PDUs and RPPs.  This concern is regarding the PDI 400kVA PDU in particular.  There is perforated metal sheet metal on the sides of the cabinet, along with large gaps underneath the PDU Stand.  This causes Raised Floor Air, which is intended for the I.T. Cabinets, to leak into and out the bottom of the PDU Cabinet.  While I did not take measurements, past experience has shown this can be 2000-3000 cfm.  Multiplied by four PDUs, this equates to around 8,000-12,000 cfm, which is between 33-50% of the output air of an entire CRAC unit (40 Ton CRACs are rated at 24,000 cfm each).

You may or may not recall we ran into this problem with the 300kVA SPDUs at T5√ñlarge penetrations in the SPDU Stands leaking air.  We√≠ve since corrected this after asking PDI whether the PDU Transformers are cooled convectively, with above-floor ambient air.  PDI confirmed that they are.

My question:  are these 400 kVA units cooled the same way?  Convectively?  If so, we need to seal up the top of the PDU Stands to prevent raised floor air loss.

Unfortunately, I believe Inglett and Stubbs, the Electrical Contractor, has the Submittals on the PDUs, so I cannot run this answer down myself.

I would like to ask you to please inquire with your engineering teams at the factory, and get an answer back to me.
BTW some skirting was provided by either PDI or Inglett which wrapped around the base of the PDU.  It did not have a good aesthetic appearance, and will not solve the problem, as Raised Floor air will flow up into the PDU Cabinet and out through the perforated metal.

I would like to ask you to please inquire with your engineering teams at the factory, and get an answer back to me. BTW some skirting was provided by either PDI or Inglett which wrapped around the base of the PDU. It did not have a good aesthetic appearance, and will not solve the problem, as Raised Floor air will flow up into the PDU Cabinet and out through the perforated metal. The bottom really needs to be sealed at the 4√Æ seal-tite conduits to do this correctly. ",True

1297,"Larry,
Per our conversation the other day you have two open items:
√Ø	Internal CT√≠s on the Endfeed is reversed. This can be correct two different ways. 
o	Customer shuts down the load, removes the input wires, and reverses the CT in the correct direction: ( Preferred method)
o	PDI would have to use a special tool to remove the wires from the internal Circuit board and reverse the wires at the connector to the board. This will have to be scheduled.
√Ø	Busway has a small amount of load at 5 amps per phase.  PDI will investigate to see what can be done to show the low current on the infeed circuit boards.
 
Thanks for continued support.

1.	PDU-N1 (ECMS)
2.	PDU-N2 (ECMS)
3.	PDU-N3 (SS-IT)

B.	Generally, the work was completed without any significant problems and within the previously-anticipated time-frame.

C.	However, it should be noted that, due to the lack of required machine screw fasteners being shipped with the replacement circuit board mounting plates, OPC and Partitions were able to step-in furnish the necessary mounting hardware (from attic stock) for PDI to use thus avoiding the need for PDI technicians to leave the site to visit a local hardware supply and procure the necessary fasteners. The hardware is a very minor cost item but a potential for huge aggravation when working during off normal hours.

D.	In addition, the following condition was discovered and require follow-up repair by PDI Service.

1.	Upon removal of voltage from PDU-N1 (Source S2 Input from CDB), the MHI display screen indicated a voltage of approximately 200V remaining on the S2 input Phase B and Phase C. Source S2 supply was in the required secure L-O/T-O position.
2.	The PDI technician believes the voltage indication, on what should have been a √¨zero-volt√Æ dead bus, is caused by a deteriorated internal capacitor bank connected to the static transfer switch (STS). The capacitors are field-replicable and will require another shut-down for the replacement work.
3.	PDI did not anticipate the present condition was an √¨immediate√Æ need (today) repair item.
4.	Also, it is not known if the PDU capacitors are an item recommended for replacement at certain in-service time intervals (like the capacitors in the UPS). PDI is supposed to advise on recommended replacement at the earliest.

It looks like we shipped the end feed with 208V label. This should have been 400V label for fidelity similar to SO28200.
 
Wayne,
 
Can you please provide a replacement label for the end feed with 400V ?

Ajith,
 
Wanted to update you on this.
 
SO is entered and the JO√≠s are all in place.
 
I created an i-job last week to get the end feed started, and at that time I thought we were good on materials.
 
The MOD18063 (the CT√≠s) showed 15 in stock but they are all non-usable.
 
I believe this is due to an incorrect resistor on the harness.
 
Connect With Us is getting us new harnesses but we may not have them until the end of the month.
 
I can check to see how hard it is to install this in the field if you like.
 
Purchasing is trying to improve the delivery of the MOD18063 and I should have an answer after lunch.
 
I√≠ll keep you posted as I get more information.
 
Regards,
 
Bill

1460,"Attached you will find a list of the boxes we had to recover and fix yesterday. Im not 100% sure this list is complete as a few were repaired onsite and mixed around a little. 
 
The customer initially brought to our attention that some of his equipment was not working correctly. They were showing an alarm on their rack mount PDU strips. 
The customer then took a standard residential type electrical outlet tester and plugged it into the 5-15R2 receptacles on the bottom of the TOBs. Most, if not all were showing an open ground. 
 
After arriving onsite I explained that the √¨teeth√Æ of the TOB is what is supposed to connect the bus ground to the TOBs. 
I had brought an example of a tap off box that we had at the office. 
As soon as I set the box on the table we could tell there was a difference in √¨teeth√Æ subcomponent of the TOB. 
But we continued to trouble shoot. The only way we could get the customers TOBs to ground properly were to jame the TOB into the bus as hard as possible, and rock it back and forth to tr to scuff up the bottom of the bus. And only then did it sometimes make a ground. The customer felt this was unsatisfactory. 
 
2nd smaller issue. We discovered with a continuity tester that the second rail after the splice pack didn√≠t even have ground. I suspected the little stickers that ship on top of the rails at the very ends were still on (because those stickers are pretty hard to see, I would suggest they get printed on bright yellow or green material instead of see through). Upon inspection I did not see the stickers, but I cleaned off the bare aluminum best I could and then really torqued down on the screws that hold on the top plate. After that there seemed to be a good connection. Im not sure how, but I feel like there should be a better means to make sure that ground is made properly. 
 
The customer is already behind setting up this little lab section. He was adamant we get the un-groundable TOBs corrected as soon as possible. 
We both felt that the √¨teeth√Æ were the culprit. 
 
Instead of waiting a week or so to ship the units back and forth and get new teeth on them, we decided we would start disassembling a stack of TOBs we happen to have in our office since that customer asked us to hold on to them until they were ready for them. 
We removed all the teeth from the Netscout TOBs, and replaced them with teeth from the order that is meant for American Airlines.",0,50046000007NyT3AAK,"Attached you will find a list of the boxes we had to recover and fix yesterday. Im not 100% sure this list is complete as a few were repaired onsite and mixed around a little. The customer initially brought to our attention that some of his equipment was not working correctly. They were showing an alarm on their rack mount PDU strips. The customer then took a standard residential type electrical outlet tester and plugged it into the 5-15R2 receptacles on the bottom of the TOBs. Most, if not all were showing an open ground. After arriving onsite I explained that the √¨teeth√Æ of the TOB is what is supposed to connect the bus ground to the TOBs. I had brought an example of a tap off box that we had at the office. As soon as I set the box on the table we could tell there was a difference in √¨teeth√Æ subcomponent of the TOB. But we continued to trouble shoot. The only way we could get the customers TOBs to ground properly were to jame the TOB into the bus as hard as possible, and rock it back and forth to tr to scuff up the bottom of the bus. And only then did it sometimes make a ground. The customer felt this was unsatisfactory. 2nd smaller issue. We discovered with a continuity tester that the second rail after the splice pack didn√≠t even have ground. I suspected the little stickers that ship on top of the rails at the very ends were still on (because those stickers are pretty hard to see, I would suggest they get printed on bright yellow or green material instead of see through). Upon inspection I did not see the stickers, but I cleaned off the bare aluminum best I could and then really torqued down on the screws that hold on the top plate. After that there seemed to be a good connection. Im not sure how, but I feel like there should be a better means to make sure that ground is made properly. The customer is already behind setting up this little lab section. He was adamant we get the un-groundable TOBs corrected as soon as possible. We both felt that the √¨teeth√Æ were the culprit. Instead of waiting a week or so to ship the units back and forth and get new teeth on them, we decided we would start disassembling a stack of TOBs we happen to have in our office since that customer asked us to hold on to them until they were ready for them.

issue of momentary grounding (short-circuit) of one of the busbar connection on STS output panel. We had alarm on STS-4B as per the attachment. The STS transferred the load to source-2 but we observed imbalance voltage at the output even though the voltage of Source-2 was normal. We did not observe any abnormality on SAS board and pulse gate driver board but observed that the LED on DC gate driver board on source-2 side was not glowing (snap attached). After discussion with you we put STS on Source-2 bypass as per SOP. We have switched off Input 1 and 2 breakers and Isolator breaker 1 and 2. 
The site was connecting a new RPP and the wrench slipped and shorted across the busbars in the output distribution panel.

1577,"Hello all,

Just to update everyone on this thread.  We found the cause of the phase rotation issue.  That signal is driven from the input voltage sensing of the unit.  When I measured that voltage I found phase C was lower than normal.  Suspecting an issue with the fuse, I traced the signal back and noted some damage to the input voltage sensing wires of the PDU.  This would account for false indication of rotation.  Unfortunately we cannot fix the issue with the unit live.  The termination is directly in contact with the main breaker line side.  We will require a shut down of the PDU to resolve.  I have attached pics of the damaged wires.  The result of no fixing this issue immediately should be minor.  You will get input voltage alarms/rotation and possible frequency alarms.  The unit should provide power normally though.  We discussed onsite and there may be some loads that need switching.  I also told Kurino that we would bring a new board in case the repair requires that as well.

1645,"From Customer: Good afternoon Thun, 
Can you please help me out with getting part information and repair procedures for these deficiencies found during the last maintenance cycle?
The attached images are for the deficiencies found for the CT plugs and wires on the M4G board. We would need to know the repair procedure for this board and partial wire harness/plug replacement. 
The B4 PDU has CTs that were disconnected and not shorted so at the recommendation of the techs, those CTs are most likely bad now and would need to be replaced. 
Could you also provide a repair procedure for the CT replacement so we can determine when we would be able to schedule the PDU for repair?
The QC4 PDU BC1 is another one high on the priority list since the TVSS is currently bad along with the fuse block. Could you please include the repair procedures for this?

From Keith Waterman: I spoke with both Jeff and Vince as they did the PM.
Yes the M4-G boards will have to be replaced and the connector will be cut off and replaced with new. Wire will be cut back to remove damaged insulation, then reterminated.
The fuse block feeding the TVSS and TVSS itself will have to be replaced as there is a short inside the existing TVSS that caused fuses to blow and damage to fuse block.
The subfeed CTs were never terminated to a BCMS resistor board as there is no BCMS or Resistor card on the unit. I don√≠ know if it was removed or never ordered with, but it is strange that the unit would be installed with CTS on the output breakers without this circuitry. I√≠ll look at the SN to see if it was originally configured with monitoring.",0,5004600000A268fAAB,"From Customer: Good afternoon Thun, Can you please help me out with getting part information and repair procedures for these deficiencies found during the last maintenance cycle?

Please send us the missing items (24 ea. Screws and 4 ea. Eyebolts). Note this is not the first time that these are missing.

Also we have two more on Order (PO 50-06966). Please make sure they are shipped complete. 

Previously we received a Transformer without any Labels (ID and Taps labels).
This Transformer has been in our Stock room for a while now.

2195,"From Tommy: So when I went out there to update to the BETA software, (April 15) and had serious issues.  The monitors would go into a reboot cycle and nothing I did made them work.  I then reloaded 1.015 with no problems.  I believe ATS is causing the issue but I don√≠t know enough about networking to figure it out.  I√≠m happy to entertain any thoughts on how to proceed.  I know we recently put out a CTS issue with the web viewer and this may be related but I can√≠t be sure.  My MicroSD card reader may be the issue but like I said, 1.015 loaded perfectly fine.   Below is an example of the CTS cycling with the BETA installed.

If you read below there√≠s really been two separate issues regarding comms.  The first one happened when the site was √¨writing√Æ to the BCMS boards.  They would periodically scan our addresses for breaker sizes and thresholds, and if it saw something different, the BMS would √¨write√Æ.  It cause the COMM 2 alarm on PDU√≠s (subfeed current) or any channel on the RPP√≠s.  When I asked them to turn write function off then the problem went away.  That was happening more frequently.  

Afterward they noticed that Displays wouldn√≠t respond to touch to wake up and the ethernet port was not connecting anymore.  I tried doing mdscan to a unit and pulling up the web interface and got no activity.  I push the reset and the unit comes back online.  Below is a sequence of what screens I found bad and when.

1/25 I had 5 screens

So we have a total of 16 PDU√≠s and 32 RPP√≠s.  That√≠s 48 color touch screens in the Data Hall.  At a frequency of 1 failure per week or so, the next one to √¨fail√Æ is unpredictable.  I√≠m happy to go there and collect data, but at this point I√≠m not sure what else to do.  I had the site investigate the polling rates and nothing looked to frequent.

CB 2 breaker on the subfeeds was tripped, the other 3 CB√≠s were in the closed position.
I asked what happened and he stated he saw smoke and a pop. He hit the EPO button in response to the smoke. I asked him what he was doing and he stated he was performing out of phase transfers. Again when he got to 120 degrees out of phase, then this is where the issue happened.
The buses on the sub feed breakers showed burned marks. See pics
This unit has already been through 4 hours of burn in and thermal readings have already been taken. 
The electricians could not find any issues with the load bank or the load bank wires. 
I fully checked the STS for any other shorts and damages and found none. None in the PCB cabinet or on the SCR. I also checked the PDU transformer and all the connections. No other shorts could be found.
Possible cause could have been loose bolts on the output buss. I shook the bus bar then they were loose. But this could have been cause after the short. Not sure.
Attached are the logs from each unit and the plots for today.

During the meeting this morning, unit G15-6 has been ruled out by the commissioning team of causing any issues to the ups.
The unit we still need to repair is 
E15-1. The subfeed distribution shorted. The commission team has stated the bolts being loose.

Hello Ajith, 
We just got this shipment in from you and both boxes were very damaged in shipping. Both of the transformers are damaged exactly like in the first picture. The packaging was not enough to keep these parts safe. 
As you can see in the last picture, the part was falling right out of the bottom of the box which is why the mounting hole is damaged on both parts. Please advise of RMA number to return these and can you assure the replacements will have adequate packing material?

Thanks,
Kathy

2503,"various issues for Dell Plano, TX shipments.  there are pictures for each of the items. picture is inside the email attached.

Issue 1 : 
Action Item #1
What the hex is under this heat shrink tube. We need to know. 
 

here√≠s why we need to know: During load bank testing, an IR gun showed this little section to be over 270 degrees Fahrenheit on every single end feed. All other sections appeared to be normal temperatures expect for whatever is behind this piece of shrink tube. 
Is this a concern for PDI? Is that the way it√≠s supposed to operate? What is its function?

Issue 2 
Action Item #2
USB service port on the undersize of end feed accumulator box. This seems like an awesome idea, haven√≠t seen it in the past but I√≠m glad it√≠s on there now. One big issue though√ñ..it was only installed on 6 of the total 10 boxes that were shipped out. (I√≠m guessing the 4 without them came from SO 24252?)  
We need to provide cables and services to put it in the other 4 empty spaces. 
Also on the 4 end feeds that were missing USB service cables, they were also all missing PDI stickers, and two with the USB cables were missing stickers too.  
To make a long story short, we need six sets of PDI PowerWave Stickers, and 4 sets of USB services ports installed. 
 

 


Issue 3 
Action Item #3
One of the end feeds was shipped out with what I would consider a female BCMS connector, the other nine end feeds had male ends in them. All the starter rails were shipped out with female connectors.
We need someone to swap out the connector of the wrong end feed in the field please. 
 

 


Issue 4 
Action Item #4
One of the BCMS rail cables were accidently pitched and severed while the load bank end feed connection boxes were being used. 
Dell and contractor are both pretty sure they did that and it was not shipped out from the factory that way. The good news it√≠s at the very very end of the rail, and there is absolutely no plans in the future to expand these lengths, so I think, it shouldn√≠t affect any downstream connections. 
What we need answered is what do you want Dell/Entech to do, should they just cap the wire with a piece of heat shrink?  should they try to strip back the wire and fix it back to the connector? Does PDI Field services fix it? will it still work the way it is now? 
 

Issue 5 
Action Item #5
During the initial load banking, Entech was able to access all the BCMS Cards in the end feeds. Good news is they were able to see voltage and current at every single CT. Bad news is they were way off. Which is probably expected? please confirm
Each set of CTs had to be calibrated from the 500+ amps they were showing, down to the 345 ish amps of known load.
Not a huge problem since Entech has been trained on how to do that with your software, however, now there are VERY CONCERNED about the calibration of the CTs in each of their tap off boxes. They do not want to load bank and calibrate each tap off box, but are thinking they may have to if we cannot produce something to easy their worries. 
They would like to know if there is any sort of calibration or testing that goes on at the factory before these ships out, or if there is any document that will ensure each of their CT strips are to conform to a certain level of accuracy.

Action Item #6
Can we schedule Startup for some time the first week of august? I know there are service dollars available from SO 24252. 
If that tech is going to be fixing some of the communication connections on site we may actually want to get him out there sooner rather than later before they turn all the loads on permanently and are unable to work on the equipment hot. But by the end of the first week of august, there will be live load with a few tap off boxes in each rail that the startup tech can help Entech with addressing, labeling, communication stuff ect√ñ... 
It would also be good if the tech can help them with some issues they have with their BCMS on their RPPs√ñbut that√≠s really a whole different deal we need to tackle later.

Some of the CTs shipped out as black SqD√ñ.some as white some other brand I don√≠t remember. What will be supplied in future? 

also, just wanted to bring it to factories attention, the last starter rail that we shipped out in a hurry was shipped out with the incorrect screws that are meant for the PT wires. The threads of the screw did not match the bus bar.
Not a huge issue since home depot happened to have the screws that were needed, just thought I would bring it to attention since I had the picture and this email already typed out.",0,50046000000rC6UAAU,"various issues for Dell Plano, TX shipments. there are pictures for each of the items. picture is inside the email attached. Issue 1 : Action Item #1 What the hex is under this heat shrink tube. We need to know. here√≠s why we need to know: During load bank testing, an IR gun showed this little section to be over 270 degrees Fahrenheit on every single end feed. All other sections appeared to be normal temperatures expect for whatever is behind this piece of shrink tube. Is this a concern for PDI? Is that the way it√≠s supposed to operate? What is its function? Issue 2 Action Item #2 USB service port on the undersize of end feed accumulator box. This seems like an awesome idea, haven√≠t seen it in the past but I√≠m glad it√≠s on there now. One big issue though√ñ..it was only installed on 6 of the total 10 boxes that were shipped out. (I√≠m guessing the 4 without them came from SO 24252?) We need to provide cables and services to put it in the other 4 empty spaces. Also on the 4 end feeds that were missing USB service cables, they were also all missing PDI stickers, and two with the USB cables were missing stickers too. To make a long story short, we need six sets of PDI PowerWave Stickers, and 4 sets of USB services ports installed. Issue 3 Action Item #3 One of the end feeds was shipped out with what I would consider a female BCMS connector, the other nine end feeds had male ends in them. All the starter rails were shipped out with female connectors. We need someone to swap out the connector of the wrong end feed in the field please.

2635,"few weeks back there were some issues with the distributed powered busway as it was delivered to the CSC Delivery Center in Bossier City, LA.
All eight of the busways had an incorrectly constructed wiring harness connecting the accumulator board to the Lantronix Xpress DR+ Modbus converter.
I've attached images from one of the devices highlighting to show that the Phoenix Connector on the accumulator board side was wired left to right instead of right to left, or vice versa.
Additionally the Xpress DR+ had the Lantronix default firmware installed on all eight of the busways, 6.1 instead of the required 3.2, which prevented the Lantronix device from accepting the appropriate settings for Modbus conversions.
Also attached an image of the only identifying information on the end feed box I could find to identify the site.
At the Bossier City site, I have successfully established communicate via Modbus TCP at one site with a 2 second pull rate with a max request of 8 coils or 8 registers in the request.
However this is quite slow and took a while to settle on, so I would like to have theoretical maximums to start at and back off from for future jobs.

The holes punched on the copper bars are also uneven.

Now the customer DC Science wants an email from Quality department mentioning that this will not be an issue when a 2 hole lug and proper torqueing applied and also confirming that PDI will look into this and correct the same for future supplies if any. Kindly arrange to do the needful.

Secondly, we also found that the gap between the 2 busway copper bars at the coupler joint location is around 5mm after putting the coupler divider plate and pulling the two bars together. This also needs a verification at the factory level because our manual calls for 3.175mm gap but no tolerance mentionined.

The temperature at the time of shut down was 300F.  Once the PDU cooled, the technicians tried to pull/wiggle the DLO wiring to determine if it was loose.  It was not.  Next, they checked torque of the mechanical lug and found that to be tight as well.

The STS has again transferred to Source 2 today, and will not go to source 1 unless you do a half bypass and try again.

On Tuesday when I first got the service call in building 4 STS had transferred to Source 2
- Checked all connections of connectors and ribbons. Once I brought the Unit back online it held up.

On Friday when I was called about the STS
I placed unit on Maintenance Bypass and conducted the following:

- On the Gate drive board, and DC board I checked, and reconnected connectors going to board of source 1.

Hello Mohammed,

I√≠m in the field supporting commissioning on 20 Infinity PDU√≠s.  I have had some issues that I√≠ve worked through but there is a single issue that I need some help with.  

PDU S/N 112-0056-17

The display is communicating locally/remotely and all functions seem to work correctly with the exception of the LED directly below the touchscreen.  I suspected that the micro SD card has some issue.  I removed the control power and swapped the SD card with another unit, and the LED started working again.  I put the original card back in the display.  I√≠d like to get your input on a possible cause and see if you could supply me with the correct files to store on the SD card.  

I have attached pics from the display and of our label.


Issue two: notes from tommy - spread sheet attached 

Spent most of the day working at Serverfarm on the Infinity startups/commissioning.  We have 26 issues assigned to us onsite that will require some sort of resolution to move forward.

I√≠ve explained to them that the software issues is a priority for us and we have people on it, with some resolution soon.  

Total issues are 26 as I said with 10 related to these software glitches/resets, 1 is a fuse I need to replace (I√≠ll try to source locally), CT strip issues (may be software but they appear to be bad CT√≠s), and we also had some breakers trip during load bank burn in today.

The breakers tripping were likely due to high ambient temps in the room.  Cooling has been locking up during burnins and the ambient got over 95deg during the two hour burn in.  Surface temps on the breakers exceeded 120 deg F.  We had 4 pdu√≠s that had tripped breakers.  We reset and restarted burn in.  After burnin we also let the room cool for 2 hrs and reloaded only those breakers to just under max capacity for 2 additional hours.  No further tripping.

We have a significant number of ct strips not registering currents.  By my count we have tested 40 panel boards (10 pdus, so half of them) and I have missing currents on at least 12 CT strips.  There may be more as I was rushing to get the testing done but also trying to get pics and notes.  I√≠ll supply more detail on this tomorrow.

I have also run an ISSUE report and formatted it for excel which I am attaching for your review.  I only have two more days there before IST so issue resolution is gonna be difficult since we have about 10 more units to test.",0,50046000008IOFsAAO,"Issue one: notes from tommy - Hello Mohammed, I√≠m in the field supporting commissioning on 20 Infinity PDU√≠s.

2935,"Notes from technician 

As you may have heard I had an issue at a site here in Brewster Washington yesterday.  I was onsite only to start up a standalone sts but the customer requested that I look at another issue.

I discussed with Sarah and she said to help them out with an inspection but to inform her if something significant needs to occur.  I arrived and found that the STS was online supporting load from source 2.

There was a phase rotation alarm on the STS from source 2.  The site stated that Kelly Ryan performed the startup in April but at that time they had only pulled the power in (single source) to source 1 and that the two were jumpered together.  First think I checked was the voltage drop between the two.  The phase indication on the display stated that there as only 2deg between phases but I measured A-A:120vac, B-B:12vac, and C-C:240vac.  They are aware there is a phase shift between the two sources and are working to resolve that issue in their power distribution.  In the course of inspecting the unit I noted first that there were screws in the bottom of the SCR logic tray.  I then inspected the three circuit boards (SAS,Pulse,Gate Drive) and the SAS had two bottom screws missing and the Pulse appeared to have no screws supporting it.  I asked the customer to place the unit in Bypass but since they didn√≠t obtain permission they said I could not take the load off 2 source protection.  I should have told them that I could not move forward, but I decided to try and inspect the board further.  Due to the plugs and ribbon cable I wasn√≠t 100% sure that no screws were supporting the board.  

I put on 40 cal arc flash top and gloves and tried to pull the board away from the standoffs.  The rear of the board made contact with the bottom left standoff and shorted the rear pins to ground.  I saw an arc on the left side of the board and looked up at the display.  The unit showed shut down with several alarms.  I immediately informed the customer (they were right behind me the whole time) and requested to reenergize the load from bypass on source 2.  He told me to proceed.  The input supply to source 2 had tripped, it was reset and shut.

I showed voltage available on S2 and energized the output.  The customer then proceeded with their equipment recovery which took about 20 minutes.  I called Sarah and John and informed them of the load loss.  I also started to inspect the unit further (de-energized the SAS, Pulse, Gate drive) to determine the extent of the damage.  The Pulse board was removed and there was obvious damage to the rear from the short.  I also found all three phases of the S2 scrs reading on 14 ohms and A phase of S1 also shorted.  I do not know the status of the snubber boards.  I then proceeded to the STS I was there to startup.

Please see attached report for the Incident.  The customer is obviously anxious to get repairs done but I told them that we needed to shut the unit down for repair.  They stated that would be an issue and could we repair with the unit energized and I told them that would not be advisable.  I have received an email from Jason Weidauer JWeidauer@ldpassociates.com already asking for an update on a repair timeline.  I told him we would update as soon as possible.  I have attached few pics and wish I had gotten more but the situation moved pretty fast once I shorted the board.

Eddy also asked for my report as soon as possible so if we could release today, I think that may help move things forward.",0,50046000007OClEAAW,"Notes from technician As you may have heard I had an issue at a site here in Brewster Washington yesterday. I was onsite only to start up a standalone sts but the customer requested that I look at another issue. I discussed with Sarah and she said to help them out with an inspection but to inform her if something significant needs to occur. I arrived and found that the STS was online supporting load from source 2. There was a phase rotation alarm on the STS from source 2. The site stated that Kelly Ryan performed the startup in April but at that time they had only pulled the power in (single source) to source 1 and that the two were jumpered together. First think I checked was the voltage drop between the two. The phase indication on the display stated that there as only 2deg between phases but I measured A-A:120vac, B-B:12vac, and C-C:240vac. They are aware there is a phase shift between the two sources and are working to resolve that issue in their power distribution. In the course of inspecting the unit I noted first that there were screws in the bottom of the SCR logic tray. I then inspected the three circuit boards (SAS,Pulse,Gate Drive) and the SAS had two bottom screws missing and the Pulse appeared to have no screws supporting it. I asked the customer to place the unit in Bypass but since they didn√≠t obtain permission they said I could not take the load off 2 source protection.

I am certain that STS1_B_01 and SPDU_5G_06 have duplicate MAC address√≠ and that is the problem there.  As far as everything else, I am unsure.

If we can change the MAC on STS1_B_01 to 02:00:01:59:00:0e, and SPDU_5G_06 to 02:00:01:59:00:0f that should fix those issues.  That MAC scheme is our in house set address for devices that we track.
