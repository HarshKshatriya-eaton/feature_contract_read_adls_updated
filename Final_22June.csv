7792,50046000000rCHFAA2,STS Monitor Has Horizontal lines . Needs to be replaced. PCB08845F,Hardware Issue - STS,The first unit STS'PDU37 had bad current readings on the output of the PDU.  I measured the actual amperage on each breaker to verify that the readings were incorrect.  After trouble shooting I was able to correct the problem of the amperage of each breaker being incorrect and I showed the customer what was done to confirm the problem was corrected.  The other STS'PDU39 had a bad monitor so when I changed the monitor the problem was corrected.  I left site with no problems and customer,Site Visit,PCB ,replace,Closed,1/20/2016 23:16,411-0150,411-0150,1.0,Product_1__c,411-0150-1
