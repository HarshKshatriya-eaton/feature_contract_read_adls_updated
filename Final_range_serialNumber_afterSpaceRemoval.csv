Customer and I agreed that work was safe to perform with proper precautions.  Placed wavestar STS on bypass on source 1 verified good bypass by testing milli-voltage across bypass breaker before opening ISO breakers and S1 input. Placed rubber insulating blankets across input busses and bypass breakers and output buss. Cyrus technician assisted with removal and replacement of bottom fan tray. Removed fan power fuses and unbolted and removed fan tray. Found new replacment fan tray had female molex instead of male had to cut fan power wires and butt splice existing male molex to match existing wiring in STS unit  replaced fan fuses and verified proper operation of fan. Removed all rubber blankets and replaced all covers.Took unit out of full bypass verified all alarms cleared and unit in normal operation  RPP-AR5-1/DR3-5 found loose voltage molex connection at BCMS card properly seated voltage molex and all alrms cleared and proper voltage was displayed.,Site Visit,Fans,replace,Closed,4/26/2017 18:48,411-0238,411-0238,1.0,Product_1__c,True,411-0238-1

1203,50046000000rCHFAA2,STS Monitor Has Horizontal lines . Needs to be replaced. PCB08845F,Hardware Issue - STS,The first unit STS'PDU37 had bad current readings on the output of the PDU.  I measured the actual amperage on each breaker to verify that the readings were incorrect.  After trouble shooting I was able to correct the problem of the amperage of each breaker being incorrect and I showed the customer what was done to confirm the problem was corrected.  The other STS'PDU39 had a bad monitor so when I changed the monitor the problem was corrected.
